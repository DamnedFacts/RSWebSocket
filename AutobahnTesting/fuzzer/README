This is the "fuzzer" used for fuzz testing against the Autobahn suite. 
In the case of RSWebSocket, we are using the fuzzer in a server context.

To start the fuzzer server:
	$ python fuzzing_server.py

This fuzzer server is a modification of the one that comes with Autobahn (http://autobahn.ws/) 
to work specifically with RSWebSocket. It will require that you have the Autobahn Websocket 
Python modules installed (version 0.5.1, currently). It will run our RSWebSocket unit tester through
the entire Autobahn testsuite, checking the expected results of each test along the way.

To run RSWebSocket unit tests against the fuzzer:
With the RSWebSocket XCode project open, and with the above fuzzing_server.py running, you can 
then run the unit tests by invoking Command-U or the Product->Test menu item. You can then type 
Command-7 to go to the Log Navigator to see each unit test execute against the fuzzer.
